  <comment>Currently Spring Security SAML module doesn&apos;t provide a starter for Spring Boot. Moreover, its configuration is XML-based as of this writing. The aim of this project is to explain how to develop a Service Provider (SP) which uses Spring Boot and Spring Security SAML Extension, by defining an annotation-based configuration (Java Configuration). Thymeleaf is also used as template engine. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
